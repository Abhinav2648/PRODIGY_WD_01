          Virat Kohli  (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international
           cricketer who plays Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket for the Indian national team.
            A former captain in all formats, Kohli retired from Twenty20 International (T20I) following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. 
           He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Delhi in domestic cricket.
            He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.

          Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar,
           whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket.
            Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.
            [22][23] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented.
             Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.
             [24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.
             [25] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.
             [26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies 
             great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[28]

          Kohli made his ODI debut gainst Sri Lanka in August 2008,[2] and scored his first century the following year when he made 107 against the same team at Eden Gardens,
           Kolkata. His 86-ball 133 not out against Sri Lanka in February 2012 led India to the second highest run-chase by any team in Australia.[b][4][5] Former Australian
            cricketer Dean Jones described the innings as "One of the greatest ODI knocks of all time!".[6] Kohli's highest score of 183 came against Pakistan during the 2012 Asia Cup;
             India successfully chased a target of 330 set by Pakistan and Kohli was adjudged man of the match. Following that, he made his first century as a captain while playing against
              the West Indies in the 2013 Triangular Series.[7] In the bilateral series against Australia in October 2013, Kohli made two centuries in successful run-chases. The first of the two,
               100 not out, was scored off 52 balls and remains the fastest ODI century by an Indian.[8] The next century, which was scored off 61 balls, remains the third-fastest by an Indian as
                of September 2019.[9] As of November 2023, Kohli has the most ODI centuries of any player after scoring his 50th ODI century in the 2023 Cricket World Cup knockout stage against
                 New Zealand with a score of 117, and ranks second overall on the list of players who have scored the most centuries in international cricket.[10][11][12]
